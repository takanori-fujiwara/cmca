## cMCA: Contrastive Multiple Correspondence Analyis

About
-----
* cMCA is from: Fujiwara and Liu, "Contrastive multiple correspondence analysis (cMCA): using contrastive learning to identify latent subgroups in political parties." PLOS ONE, forthcoming. [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04540)
  * cMCA finds principal components along which a target categorical dataset has more variance when compared to a background categorical dataset.
  * This implementation also integrates automatic selection of a contrast parameter (a hyperparameter of cMCA), which is originally developed for contrastive principal component analysis (cPCA) in: Fujiwara et al., "Network Comparison with Interpretable Contrastive Network Representation Learning", Journal of Data Science, Statistics, and Visualisation, 2022. [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12419)
  * Other use cases (using machine maintenance data) can be found in: Zhan et al., "A Visual Analytics Approach for the Diagnosis of Heterogeneous and Multidimensional Machine Maintenance Data." Proc. PacificVis, 2021.
